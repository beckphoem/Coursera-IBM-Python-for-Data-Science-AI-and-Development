Let's use the left part of the screen to display the different values of the variable square and I for the various iterations of the loop

 For the first iteration, the value of the variable is red corresponding to the zeroth index, and the value for I is zero

 For the second iteration, the value of the variable square is yellow, and the value of I corresponds to its index, i

e

, 1

 We repeat the process for the last index

 While loops are similar to for loops but instead of executing a statement a set number of times a while loop will only run if a condition is met

 Let's say we would like to copy all the orange squares from the list squares to the list New squares

 But we would like to stop if we encounter a non-orange square

 We don't know the value of the squares beforehand

 We would simply continue the process while the square is orange or see if the square equals orange

 If not, we would stop

 For the first example, we would check if the square was orange

 It satisfies the conditions so we would copy the square

 We repeat the process for the second square

 The condition is met

 So we copy the square

 In the next iteration, we encounter a purple square

 The condition is not met

 So we stop the process

 This is essentially what a while loop does

 Let's use the figure on the left to represent the code

 We will use a list with the names of the color to represent the different squares

 We create an empty list of new squares

 In reality, the list is of indeterminate size

 We start the index at zero the while statement will repeatedly execute the statements within the indent until the condition inside the bracket is false

 We append the value of the first element of the list squares to the list Newsquares

 We increase the value of I by one

 We append the value of the second element of the list squares to the list new squares

 We increment the value of I

 Now the value in the array squares is purple; therefore, the condition for the while statement is false and we exit the loop
