# 1.1.1 Introduction to Python

## What you will learn

After watching this video, you will be able to:
- identify the users of Python. 

- List the benefits of using Python. 
- Describe the diversity and inclusion efforts of the Python community. 

## Python

Python is a powerhouse of a language. It is the most widely used and most popular programming language used in the data science industry.

According to the 2019 Kaggle Data Science and Machine Learning Survey, ¾ of the over 10,000 respondents worldwide reported that they use Python regularly.

Glassdoor reported that in 2019 more than 75% of data science positions listed included Python in their job descriptions.

When asked which language an aspiring data scientist should learn first, most data scientists say Python.

## Who is Python for ?

Let’s start with the people who use Python. 

If you already know how to program, then Python is great for you because it uses clear and readable syntax.

You can develop the same programs from other languages with lesser code using Python. For beginners, 

Python is a good language to start with because of the huge global community and wealth of documentation. 

Several different surveys done in 2019 established that over 80% of data professionals use Python worldwide.

Python is useful in many areas including data science, AI and machine learning, web development, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like the Raspberry Pi.

Large organizations that heavily use python include IBM, Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify, and Reddit.

Python is widely supported by a global community and shepherded by the Python Software Foundation.

## What makes Python great

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.

It has a large, standard library that provides tools suited to many different tasks including but not limited to Databases, Automation, Web scraping, Text processing, Image processing, Machine learning, and Data analytics.

For data science, you can use Python's scientific computing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

For artificial intelligence, it has TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Scikit-learn.

Python can also be used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

## Diversity and inclusion efforts

Another great selling point for Python is that the Python community has a well-documented history of paving the way for diversity and inclusion efforts in the tech industry as a whole.

The Python language has a code of conduct executed by the Python Software Foundation that seeks to ensure safety and inclusion for all, in both online and in-person Python communities.

Communities like PyLadies seek to create spaces for people interested in learning Python in safe and inclusive environments.

PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community.
