# Lesson 1.1.3 - Getting Started with Jupyter

Welcome to “Getting started with Jupyter.” 

# What you will learn

After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Describe how to run, insert, and delete a cell in a notebook. 

- Work with multiple notebooks. 
- Present the notebook, 
- Shut down the notebook session. 

# Lauching the notebook

In the lab session of this module, you can launch a notebook using the Skills Network virtual environment. 

After selecting the check box, click the Open tool tab, and the environment will open the Jupyter Lab.

# The notebook

Here you see the open notebook. On 

# Opening a notebook

opening the notebook, you can change the name of the notebook. 

Click File. Then click Rename Notebook to give the required name.

And you can now start working on your new notebook. In the new notebook, print “hello world”.

Then click the Run button to show that the environment is giving the correct output.

# Running cells in a notebook

On the main menu bar at the top, click Run. 

In the drop-down menu, click Run Selected Cells to run the current highlighted cells. 

Alternatively, you can use a shortcut, press Shift + Enter. 

In case you have multiple code cells, click Run All cells to run the code in all the cells. 

# Inserting a new cell

You can add code by inserting a new cell. To add a new cell, click the plus symbol in the toolbar. 

# Deleting and moving cells

In addition, you can delete a cell. Highlight the cell and on the main menu bar, click Edit, and then click Delete Cells. 

Alternatively, you can use a shortcut by pressing D twice on the highlighted cell. 

Also, you can move the cells up or down as required. So, now you have learned to work with a single notebook. 

# Working with multiple notebooks

Next, let’s learn to work with multiple notebooks. 

Click the plus button on the toolbar and select the file you want to open.Another notebook will open. 

Alternatively, you can click File on the menu bar and click Open a new launcher or Open a new notebook. And when you open the new file, you can move them around. For example, as shown, you can place the notebooks side by side. 

On one notebook, you can assign variable one to the number 1, and variable two to the number 2 and then you can print the result of adding the numbers one and two.

# Presenting your notebook

As a data scientist, it is important to communicate your results. Jupyter supports presenting results directly from the notebooks. 

You can create a Markdown to add titles and text descriptions to help with the flow of the presentation.

To add markdown, click Code and select Markdown.

You can create line plots and convert each cell and output into a slide or sub-slide in the form of a presentation.

The slides functionality in Jupyter allows you to deliver code, visualization, text, and outputs of the executed code as part of a project.

# Shutting down sessions

Now, when you have completed working with your notebook or notebooks, you can shut them down. 

Shutting down notebooks release their memory. 

Click the stop icon on the sidebar, it is the second icon from the top. 

You can terminate all sessions at once or shut them down individually. 

And after you shut down the notebook session, you will see “no kernel” at the top right. 

This confirms it is no longer active, you can now close the tabs.

# Summary

In this video, you learned how to: 
- Run, delete, and insert a code cell. 

- Run multiple notebooks at the same time. 
- Present a notebook using a combination of Markdown and code cells. 
- shut down your notebook sessions after you have completed your work.
