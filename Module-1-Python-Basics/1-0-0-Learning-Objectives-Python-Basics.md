# Learning Objectives of  Python Basics

## About this course

This course was designed to provide the building blocks for Python programming and data collection for those choosing a career in Data Science, Data Engineering, AI or Application Development. 

Initially conceived as a foundation course for Data Science and AI it has been refreshed several times to keep pace with emerging career options. Additional content has been added which is applicable to Data Science, Data Engineering, AI or Application Development. 

After completing this course you will have learned foundational skills in Python programming which you can then go on to apply in the Python Project course for your chosen career.  The Python Project courses involve real world scenarios where you are in charge of a final project as a Data Scientist, a Data Engineer, or in AI and Application Development. By finishing this course and your follow-on Python Project, you will gain the basic skills to continue the steps on your chosen career path.  

Note: This course is a pre-requisite for the Python Project courses and should be completed in full before attempting the appropriate Python Project course. 


This module teaches the basics of Python and begins by exploring some of the different data types such as integers, real numbers, and strings. Continue with the module and learn how to use expressions in mathematical operations, store values in variables, and the many different ways to manipulate strings.

## Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate an understanding of types in Python by converting or casting data types such as strings, floats, and integers.
- Interpret variables and solve expressions by applying mathematical operations.
- Describe how to manipulate strings by using a variety of methods and operations.
- Build a program in JupyterLab to demonstrate your knowledge of types, expressions, and variables.
- Work with, manipulate, and perform operations on strings in Python.

## Course Overview
