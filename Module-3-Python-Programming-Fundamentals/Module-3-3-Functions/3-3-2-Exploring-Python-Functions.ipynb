    "Functions promote code modularity and reusablitiy. Imagine you have a task that needs to be performed multiple times within a program. Instead of duplicating the same code at various places, you can define a function once and call it whenever you need that task. This reduces redundancy and makes the code easier to manage and maintain.\n"

It's the value that the function `returns` to the code that called it. Think of the output as the end product of the function's work. You can use this output in your code, assign it to variables, pass it to other functions, or even print it out for display.\n",
