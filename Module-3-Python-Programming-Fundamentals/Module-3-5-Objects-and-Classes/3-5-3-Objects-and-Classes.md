### Creeating a Class

The first step in creating a class is giving it a name. In this notebook ,we will create two classes: Circle and Rectangle. We need to dertermine all the data that make up that class, wich we call attributes. THink about this step as creating a blue print that we will use to create objects. In figure 1 we see two classes, Circle and Rectange. Each has their attributes, which are vairables. The class Circle has the attribute radius and color, while the Rectangle class has the attribute height and with. Let's use the visual examples of these shapes before we get to the code, as this will help yo uget accustomed to the vocabulary.
